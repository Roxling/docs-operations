= Store formats
:description: This page describes store formats in Neo4j.

The store format dictates how a database in Neo4j, is stored on disk. 
The available formats are:

* `aligned` label:default[Default]
* `standard`
* `high_limit` label:enterprise-edition[]
* `block` label:enterprise-edition[]label:version-number[Neo4j 5.14]

Neo4j's newest store format is `block`, it has the best performance and supports the highest limits. 
`block` format is intended to replace all the older formats.
The `block` format uses a range of different data structures and inlining techniques to achieve data locality and store related data together on disk. This allows more related data to be fetched by fewer read operations, resulting in better resource utilization. 

The older store formats are based on the original `standard` format, each with different features and limitations.
Aligned, Standard, and High-limit formats store most graph data in linked list-like structures on disk. 
The `aligned` format performs better than `standard` but requires slightly more disk space.
The `high-limit` format allows more nodes and relationships to be stored than `standard` but peforms slightly worse and requires more disk space.  


== How to set the database store format

=== Creating new databases

The default store format of new databases is controlled by the xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc#config_db.format[`db.format`] configuration setting in the _neo4j.conf_ file. 
Or the store format can be passed as an argument to the tool creating the database, e.g. xref:tools/neo4j-admin/neo4j-admin-import.adoc#import-tool-full[`neo4j-admin import`] or xref:backup-restore/copy-database.adoc[`neo4j-admin copy`] commands.

=== Changing an existing database

Changing the store format is possible by re-writing all data in the new format using the `neo4j-admin database migrate` or xref:backup-restore/copy-database.adoc[`neo4j-admin copy`] commands.

Changing the store format requires that:

* The database is offline.
* There is enough disk space for both old and new copies of the database.
* The graph fits within the new xref:#neo4j-admin-store-entity-limits[format's entity limits].

Changing store format can be a time-consuming operation, depending on the size and complexity of the data in the database. Performance heavily depends on the speed of the disk and the amount of available memory.

=== Effects of store formats choice

The store format is responsible for how data is written to disk and how to read it.
Some key aspects that may differ between formats are:

* The performance and resource consumption of read and write transactions.
An operation may be faster on one store format than another.
* Size of database files on disk.
Two databases containing identical logical data may have different sizes due to different formats.
* Which files/filenames exist in the database directory.
* Performance in memory-constrained environments.
The same query on different formats may have a different page cache hit ratio when the database does not entirely fit in the page cache.
* The amount of data that can be stored.
See <<neo4j-admin-store-entity-limits, Store formats and entity limits>> for limitations of the individual formats.
* The order of query results when the order is not specified.
Different store formats may traverse and return data in different order.
* Algorithms used by the Neo4j Admin tools.
Especially `neo4j-admin database check` and `neo4j-admin database import` commands.
Performance and resource utilization may differ.
